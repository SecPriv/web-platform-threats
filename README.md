## Usage

WPT Security requires a working [docker](https://docker.io) installation, the bash shell and GNU make. Make sure the current user is in the `docker` group and that the `compose` docker plugin is installed.

### Download or build the pipeline docker images

```sh
./wpt-check pull    # or make pull
```

The command downloads three images from the github docker registry
- `wpt-runner` Browser runner for Chromium and Firefox
- `wpt-safari-runner` Browser runner for Safari (Note: this image does not include MacOS, which needs to be run separately)
- `wpt-trace-matching` Trace verifier, including trace parsing and Z3

Alternatively, the images can be built locally with the following command.

```sh
./wpt-check build   # or make
```

Note that the build **may take up to 30 minutes**, as a specific version of z3 is compiled from source.

### Verify all Web Invariants on the execution of WPT tests

```sh
./wpt-check run firefox '/cookies/secure/set-from-dom.https.sub.html'
```

The script runs the `wpt-runner` container, which executes the `/cookies/secure/set-from-dom.https.sub.html` WPT test with the instrumented `firefox` browser and collects the trace. Then, the `wpt-trace-matching` container is run, which converts the obtained execution trace to SMT-LIB, and verifies it with the Z3 theorem prover.

The verification results are printed on standard output for every subtest and invariant:
- `unsat`: the invariant is valid;
- `sat`: the invariant does not hold, i.e., Z3 could find a counterexample.

The test to execute is specified as the path of the test file in the [WPT repository](https://github.com/SecPriv/wpt/tree/wpt-security). A list of tests for each WPT subfolder can be obtained by running the `wpt` utility with the `run --list-tests` options from the WPT repository, or by executing, e.g,
```
./wpt-check -l cookies
```
to obtain a list of all tests in the `cookies` folder of WPT (`'*'` can be used to list all tests).

The `wpt-check` script supports running Firefox and Chromium. 
For Safari, refer to the [runner/safari/README.md](runner/safari/README.md) file for a guide on (i) how to install the Safari instrumentation on a MacOS system, and (ii) generate an execution trace in JSON format.
The JSON trace can be verified using the `wpt-check verify` command, as described in the following.

### Verify all Web Invariants on an execution trace in JSON format

```sh
./wpt-check verify safari_1710427255.json
```

The script converts the trace to SMT-LIB and verifies it using Z3.
The output is printed in the same format as the `wpt-check run` command.
